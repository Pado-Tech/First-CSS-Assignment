    <p>Katie Stockton, the founder of Fairlead Strategies, communicated to clients that Bitcoin convincingly surpassed the $48,600 resistance level, signaling an intermediate-term bullish development in its chart. Having surged over 40% in the past month, Bitcoin reached its highest point since November 2021. Its year-to-date increase is 44%, with a remarkable 160% gain over the past year.Stockton suggests that short-term technical indicators hint at an upcoming consolidation phase in the coming days before Bitcoin resumes its climb to test a final resistance at $64,900, as indicated by Markets Insider. In a previous analysis, Stockton emphasized this positive momentum, highlighting that several key indicators portray a favorable long-term momentum without signs of overbought conditions on the monthly chart, suggesting no immediate sell signals.Several factors, including the recent introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), have contributed to this price surge, attracting significant investments. Bitcoin has sustained a winning streak for five consecutive days, aiming for its strongest monthly performance since October 2021, amidst the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in early January.These ETFs have garnered substantial inflows, surpassing $6 billion in net inflows and continuing to drive demand in cryptocurrency.</p>
